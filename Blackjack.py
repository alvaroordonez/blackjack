#This code is based on the Udemy course milestone project
#This code will take the Class and Card classes to make a 52 card deck
#Will ask the player to make a bet agains the dealer and then play blackjack
#Player will be asek to hit or take another card
#This is a bit unique as I forgot how to play Blackjack and so the program keeps playing
#until all 52 cards are used up
